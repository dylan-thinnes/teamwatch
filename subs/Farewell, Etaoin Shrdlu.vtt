00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.650
CINE, the Council on International Non-Theatrical events has awarded this film

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.670
a Golden Eagle in token of its
excellence and has selected it to

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.990
represent the United States of America
in international motion picture events abroad.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Farewell, ETAOIN SHRDLU, Mixtrack take one

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.350
We are fast approaching press time for
the first edition of tomorrow morning's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.440
paper. This printer has just finished
makeup of a page. In the next 56 minutes,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.360
all pages must be finished and recorded
to meet the Edition deadline of 9:00 PM.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.480
But tonight's deadline is special...
this New York Times mirror image inlet

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:12.000
of tomorrow's date line reads backwards
as Sunday July 2nd 1978. It marks the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.209
last day of an age-old method of
printing in this composing room. What you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.280
are now witnessing will exist after
tonight only as a film historic record,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.900
for the century of the linotype machine
is nearing its end. Using 535 degree

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.900
molten lead it sets solid lines of type
called hot type cast in newspaper

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.500
column width. Now cooled, a printer's
hands prepare the lines for insertion

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:52.200
into a column of the page. Headlines are
still set by hand with type stored in

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.470
traditional California cases and in time-worn
Ludlow cabinets, by morning relics

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.680
of the past. Letter by letter the printer
forms the words in his composing stick,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.299
in the same way that Gutenberg, the
first printer of the western world, did

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.760
more than five centuries ago.
Brass moulds of letters are assembled in

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:24.560
a different composing stick also for
headlines. Inside this Ludlow machine,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.210
which was invented a quarter of a
century after the linotype, they will be

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:39.990
cast from liquid lead to form a solid
slug of type. By tomorrow, this Ludlow too

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.540
will be a museum piece.
These steel tables for page make up are

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.160
called printer stones. They have been
gradually abandoned over the past months.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.780
A radical changeover has taken place,
for a new era of computerized, electronic,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.150
automated, and cold type photo technology
has begun. It started in the brightly lit

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.570
area beyond these two dark hopes of
discarded linotype machines. Now lined up

NOTE I cannot identify the word characterized as "hope" - anyone who clearly
understands the word used would be welcome to fix these subtitles.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.480
for shipment, they have been the old
reliables here for decades. Tonight, 60 of

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.919
the once 140 linotypes - the largest
battery of any newspaper in the world -

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.100
are on their final stint. Before the rush
to Edition time, a makeup man spoke to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.880
us about this machine. 'You know a hundred
years ago a man named Ottmar Mergenthaler

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.620
invented a machine called the linotype.
Now it's not a machine that's well known

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.070
by most people, but I find that it was
the automation of its day. The only thing

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.570
is I think it was the machine that made
mass education possible, it brought the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.380
price of books within the range of the
average working person. This is the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.120
machine over here. Now it's practically
unchanged in a hundred years. I feel if

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.180
old man Mergenthaler came back he
could probably go over to that machine

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.900
sit down and set up a couple of
galleys of type without any problems

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.740
at all. If there were any problems as far
as fixing the machine I'm sure he could

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.890
get up and fix it. But that's how long
that machine has lasted, a hundred

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:22.350
years."

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:46.370
It all begins with this machine, really
three machines in one: assembly, casting,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.410
and redistribution. In this portion of
the machine we keep these brass

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.050
mattresses which have a letter punched
into their edge, in this case the letter

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:03.620
"M". When I press a key these mattresses
will fall along this gravity chute, and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.630
into the assembler. If I press this M,
you'll see that M come down. There it is.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.890
Now when I want to space a word, I'll drop
in a space band, which is a steel wedge.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.780
It slides up and down and spreads the
line to the exact size that I want in a

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.780
column so that every line is exactly
equal to the other in width. When we send

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.120
the line into the casting machine this
is what happens: if we take these

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.520
mattresses they'll come down and face
against this steel mold. Hot metal, molten

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.960
lead will be poured into that steel mold.
This mattress will be faced against here

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.100
with the mold of the mattress against
the top. The lead will harden and pick up

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.760
the image from the inside of this mold
and this mattress. It will turn around

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:59.990
through here, it will harden it will be
trimmed, and it will be ejected... right

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:07.130
here. Now let's watch a line go in: this
one's just about ready. Drawing across

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.560
now, the bands are spreading the line out
now, the line is being pumped in to hot

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:20.840
lead, it's hardening now, it's being trimmed
and here's your new line of type. But the

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.410
real machine is in the back it was a
watchmaker who invented it. This uniquely

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:34.820
shaped eccentric cam is the heart of his
entire system. As it rotates, it programs

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.200
all the intricate operations of this
automatic producer of type for the

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.260
composing of the paper. It makes the
linotype machine run like a huge wound

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:54.930
up clock, ticking with perfect precision.
In the meantime, these mattresses have

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.190
been redistributed and transferred into
those magazines and we can use them

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:04.979
again and again. This story is about
finished now, we can take it over to the

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:09.690
bank and get a galley proof, send it into
the proof room for proofreading, and when

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.930
we're finished with that we'll take the
type and put it either on a correction

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:21.750
bank or maybe directly into the page and
wait for the corrections. These latest

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:27.479
machines without keyboards have built-in
teletypesetter units. Instead of fingers

00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:32.070
on keys, perforated tape does the work,
like the old music roll in a player

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:40.890
piano. This enables one person to monitor
three machines at once. A solid bar or

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:47.180
"pig" of lead is lowered into the melting
pot to refill it for casting.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:09:01.260
Sign language is used among the paper's
many deaf printers. Instead of three

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.140
lines a minute the old manual way, each
machine now sets 14 lines a minute. It's

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:14.070
as far as mechanical automation could go
in the pre-electronic age. Lines of type

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:20.760
and picture cuts are made up into
full-page forms, guided by editors' layout

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.060
sheets.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:31.149
"Where does this thing go?"

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.399
"All right look you want to make a box
out of it?"

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:46.680
"We all done here?" "Yeah, it was all I got."
"We want to push it around, or do you want to end here?"

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.710
"Stick the box down in here."
"You want to make a box out of it and

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:57.070
then turn this?" The closest cooperation
is needed between the page editor and

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:04.570
the makeup. Together they almost talk
the type into the page form, coax it, cajole it,

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:12.340
to make it fit, as they work
against the clock. Everyone is aware of

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:21.930
the time. Only forty minutes are left to
the nine o'clock First Edition deadline.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:30.190
From now on, a page a minute, forty more
pages, must be completed, locked up in

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:39.120
these page forms and ready for the
pressers. Metal engravings like these

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.360
are cut down to size and precisely trimmed.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.330
The cuts will print up as the drawings
and photos you see in the paper every

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:12.680
day. The handling of type and cuts is the
job of the makeup man while the page

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.750
editor indicates to him what she wants.
Reading the type upside down and

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.820
backwards, he sees a reverse image of what
will be the final printed page, and may

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:31.809
even catch an overlooked error.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:43.000
"What does this say?" "Moaning in pain others, you had 'others' in there... get it out of there, that's a bad 's'." Only 14 minutes to

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.300
go. Everyone feels the urgency.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:04.860
Pages are nearing completion. Makeups
tighten keys to bring type and cuts

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.730
closely together
this keeps pieces from falling out when

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:16.760
forms are moved off the stones. This page
is about done.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:39.770
Almost finished. The editor sends this
one on its way. The presses are waiting. Trucks,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.630
trains, and planes must be met to rush
the paper to the city, to the country, and

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:53.650
to the world. Now this one is on its way.
And the last one to close is page one.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.179
"Okay on one!"

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:21.210
On time. And now a work break, and also a
party for old-time linotype operator

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:29.050
Albert Tanguier. "Over 49 years being
in the composing room. A senior

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:37.270
member of the priority list. The number one
man on the priority list!" "How do you feel about this?" "Well I feel I

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:45.940
feel that they call it progress but as
far as I'm concerned it is not. I would

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:56.850
like it to stay the way it was, you know.
Keep the old machine running." 
"How long have you worked here?" 
"A month short of 49 years."
"How old are you?"
"75 and a half."
"75 and a half! Are you retiring tonight?"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
"Let's have a drink on him!"
"I'm glad I had so many good friends."

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:19.480
This worker chalks up his
sentiments: 'End of an era, good while it

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:25.840
lasted,
crying won't help.' "I find it very sad,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.330
very sad. I've learned the new stuff,
the new processes and all but I've been a

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.260
printer now for 26 years, I've been in
this place for 20 years, six years

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:41.020
apprenticeship and 20 years journeyman. ANd
these are words that aren't just tossed

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.710
around, they've always meant
something to us printers. I hate to see it.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.610
It's inevitable that we're going to
go into computers all the knowledge I've

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:53.050
acquired over these 26 years is
all locked up in a little box now

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:59.160
called a computer, and I think probably most
jobs are going to end up the same way."

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.730
"Do you think computers are a good idea in general?"
"Oh there's no doubt about it
they're gonna benefit everybody

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:07.529
eventually, how long that will take I don't
know." Carefully, back on the stone

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:11.430
for changes by the news department for
the second, the Late City Edition. A

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:18.060
galley of new type for a late-breaking
story is proofed up to be read for

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:26.490
accuracy. Corrections are checked. Lines
with errors are replaced by corrected

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:37.740
lines, and page one is ready to go again
for the new deadline, 11:00 p.m. This

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.589
time we follow it to the making of a
stereotype mat.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:53.589
The mat is a damp sheet of flexible
cardboard. A solid steel roller will

00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:58.630
press it against the hundreds of
separate lines and picture cuts locked

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:10.390
together in this page form. Five minutes
to the 11 o'clock deadline. The

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:16.209
stereotyper taps down a spacing lid so
that it won't print. The mat will soon be

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:22.029
curved and dried into a half cylinder
form. From it, curved solid lead plates

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:28.149
will be cast, to fit on the rotary
presses. The pressure of one ton per

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:33.070
square inch is forced upon the cardboard.
The raised lead type presses into the mat,

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:40.050
forming a mold of recessed letters.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:48.520
The mat is now right reading, and ready
for casting.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:54.250
Down into the stereo casting
room three stories below street level, in

00:16:54.250 --> 00:17:00.880
the Times building hot lead will now pour
into the recessed impressions of type in

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.930
this curved mat.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.360
Casting starts.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.420
These mammoth machines are up for sale.
Some will go under the hammer at auction. A

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:45.160
few will be cannibalized for spare parts.

00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:58.509
Nine identical page plates to run on
nine presses at the same time are cooled

00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:03.119
in these steel chambers before rolling
into the press room.

00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:10.849
"When is this operation gonna close up?"
"It's gonna close up in the morning."

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:23.510
"How do you feel about it?" 
"Another... 'innovation'? A new process we're moving into?"

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:28.490
"How do you feel about it?"
"When I think of these machines costing over $100,000 apiece to

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.330
be junked it kind of leaves me loose.
You know this is as far as

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.140
they could go, though. As far as the
automation with the hot metal this as

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.550
far as the Times could go.
"What's that gonna mean to you, personally?"

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.390
"Means I have to learn a new
process." One after another into the

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.360
pressroom. Warning bells ring when the
presses start up.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.789
"Page one, Sports!"

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.260
These heavy plates
on their snaking and criss-crossing

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:18.170
tracks, are making their final run to the
nine presses tonight. Will the new

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:24.200
technology just a few hours away make a
big change down here? A pressman shrugs

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:31.780
it off. "Instead of using red forty pound
plates, and locking them up...

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.299
instead of using these lead weights
what we do is use a plastic plate that

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:44.720
only weighs a few ounces,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.649
and it goes on a cylinder, there's a magnetic bar
that holds it on. So you just get the

00:19:49.649 --> 00:19:54.960
hang of putting it on that's all. The rest of the job
won't change significantly."

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.490
Cheering reached the last time that a
40-pound half-cylinder plate of lead

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.980
will ever again be mounted on these
presses.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:19.430
Scrap from the previous press run is
clear from the conveyors. They carry the

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:25.400
finished papers up to the street level
above. Now the last reversal from wrong

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.600
reading type to the final, inked, right
reading, printed page.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:02.549
It all started on the linotype machine
upstairs, and it ends up... here.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.930
And the presses keep rolling through the
night.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.710
This is goodbye.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.640
Generations of linotype operators have
often run their fingers down the first

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:47.970
two rows of keys, releasing mats that
read "ETAOIN SHRDLU". This fills out

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:53.550
lines that start with keyboard errors.
The last bad line is discarded, at the

00:21:53.550 --> 00:22:04.070
end of the story. Motor off, a last touch
of familiar brass mats,

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.890
light out for good.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.840
It is the end of the age of hot type
mechanical printing

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:48.470
and the beginning of the new: the
computerized cold type, the electronic.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:01.830
These seasoned printers, retrained, have
made the transition from the old to the

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.950
new.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.750
The electronic images of letters that I
have just set on this video display

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.220
screen,
I'll now send to the computer. Where it

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:41.490
is processed, stored, and brought back
when required for corrections.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:59.840
Back to the computer. When needed a touch
of a key returns it to the editor. It is

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.950
then changed to the desired column width,
style, size of type, and hyphenation,

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:11.659
followed by further keyboarding of
headlines and bylines. Then, to one of

00:24:11.659 --> 00:24:17.059
five photo typesetters, each an
electronic mirror. Inside, a web of

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:21.980
components and wiring does the work of
140 linotypes generating a vast

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:28.390
array of electronic type images on a
concealed cathode ray tube.

00:24:30.889 --> 00:24:36.029
These images are contacted onto
photosensitive paper at a thousand lines

00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:40.229
a minute.
Emerging from the darkroom, the photo

00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:44.579
sensitized paper has now been
transformed by a developing machine into

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:50.009
photographic cold type, ready for
full-page paste up. This productivity

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:55.079
leap, from fourteen to a thousand lines a
minute is made possible several floors

00:24:55.079 --> 00:25:01.019
above by a battery of computers. These
units contain magnetized memory disks

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:06.089
and electronic digital systems, which
store and process all the data sent from

00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:15.539
below. Wwitches and buttons at a touch
bring us into an ever-advancing world of

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:21.319
automation, computerization, and
programmed electron flow.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:42.480
Humidity and temperature, monitored and
controlled around the clock, are critical.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:47.950
These cabinets hold layered packs of
yellow magnetic disks and others like

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:54.940
this. The disks, in operation, spin at 140
miles an hour. More than eight million

00:25:54.940 --> 00:26:00.310
words can be stored and sent back by
each disk pack and cold type on paper

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:07.090
keeps on flowing. Photo technology has
conquered hot metal. The typeset paper is

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:12.850
cut, waxed on the back for adhesion, and
pasted up on full-page boards on these

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:21.790
tables. "That'll bring the type down to
here."

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:26.040
"There's gonna be new type here?"
"Yes."

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:35.020
"Core, right that's holding it.
Thank you, Jenny."
From obituaries to

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:44.320
sports, to the worlds of business
entertainment, real estate, classified and

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:53.890
display advertising, and of course, the
news. These color patches will soon be

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:59.580
replaced by headlines. They are now being
cut to exact size.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:13.320
No more molten lead. He has made it from
hot type makeup to cold type paste up.

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:25.289
The last headline in place, ready to go.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.349
Page one will now be transferred
electronically through impulses from.

00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:39.339
this laser scanner machine to the plate
room underground. In a moment,

00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:44.559
the laser beam within will scan the
pasted up page. This will result in

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:50.489
14-ounce flexible plastic plates made
and used down below in the pressroom.

00:27:50.489 --> 00:27:55.899
Page after page will be run off on the
high speed rotary presses as before and

00:27:55.899 --> 00:28:07.330
folded into the finished paper. But
despite automation, computerization, and

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:13.179
the continuing advances of electronics,
the central factor is still the work of

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:30.399
the human brain, the work of human eyes,
and the work of human hands... in creating

00:28:30.399 --> 00:28:36.359
that powerful element of communication: the
printed word.
