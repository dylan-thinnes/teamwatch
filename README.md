# teamwatch

Allows you to watch movies together.

- Run `npm install`.
- Then run a webserver in the root to deliver index.html and script.js. (I use
- `http-server`, provided by `npm i -g http-server` to do this).
- Then run `node index.js` to setup websockets.
- Then go to your server.
- Select a video, and optionally subtitles.
